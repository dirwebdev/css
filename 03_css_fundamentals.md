# 03: CSS Fundamentals

Diving into the world of web development, CSS stands as a cornerstone technology alongside HTML and JavaScript. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the language used to present the document you create with HTML. It's responsible for the visual and aural layout, whether on a screen, in print, or voiced through a speech-based browser.

## What is CSS?
CSS is the styling language of the web. Its inception in the late 1990s was aimed at solving the challenges of web design flexibility and control. Before CSS, styling was rudimentary and largely embedded within HTML itself, leading to cumbersome code and limited styling capabilities. CSS introduced a separation of concerns, allowing for a clear distinction between structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS).

## How CSS Works with HTML
CSS works by selecting elements in an HTML document and applying styles to them. These styles are stored in "stylesheets" which can either be embedded directly in the HTML, linked as separate files, or included inline with specific elements. This modularity allows for extensive customization and reusability, making it easier to maintain and update the visual design of websites.

### Going Further with JavaScript
Once you've mastered HTML and CSS, incorporating JavaScript into your projects allows for dynamic modifications to CSS properties, enabling interactive and animated web experiences. This powerful trio of technologies forms the foundation of front-end web development.
