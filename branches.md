- Use feature branches for new content or updates, merging them into the appropriate content category branch for review.
- Once content is reviewed and approved in its category branch, merge into `staging` for final testing.
- After thorough testing in `staging`, content is merged into `main` for deployment.

Contributors are encouraged to adhere to these guidelines to maintain an organized and efficient workflow. For any questions or clarifications, please reach out to the project maintainers.
